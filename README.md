# njuskalo-scrapper-apartments
A simple project to help looking for an apartment in Zagreb

I needed to quickly find an apartment to rent in Zagreb somewhere close to work. Since Njuskalo.hr doesn't have a good search by location, I decided to scrape the data and build my own.
This is a Windows Forms application that loads all apartments from a specific search url to a map and saves it to a CSV file.

Notice: Pins are loaded from JSONs and represent either supermarkets or tram stations since those were important to me. 
Also, the code is a mess since it was supposed to do this one thing. I may clear it up some day.

Notice: All data you collect using this code is property of Njuskalo.hr and is subject to their terms and regulations. Any use of this code is your own responsibility.
